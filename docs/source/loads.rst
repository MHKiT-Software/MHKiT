.. _loads:

Loads Module
====================
The loads module contains a set of functions to calculate quantities of interest for assessing mechanical loads including statistics damage equivalent loads, and 
functions for visualizing data.

  Calculations are based on `IEC TS 62600-3:2020 ED1 <https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/60359>`_ .

The tidal module contains the following submodules:

* ``general``: Computes loads metrics such as damage equivalent loads.
* ``graphics``: Generates graphics of loads statistics.
* ``extreme``: Contains functions to calculate peak distribution.

See :ref:`MHKiT-Python <python>` or :ref:`MHKiT-MATLAB <matlab>` for more details on the loads module.
