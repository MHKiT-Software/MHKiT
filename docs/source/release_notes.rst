MHKiT-Python v0.9.0
-------------------
MHKiT v0.9.0 includes significant new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and updates to improve the functionality, performance, and compatibility of MHKiT:
New features:

 * Acoustics Module
    - Introduced a new Acoustics module to MHKiT, providing comprehensive tools for processing and analyzing passive acoustic data from hydrophone recordings.
    - Designed to facilitate compliance with the IEC-TS 62600-40 standard
    - Supports hydrophone models such as SoundTrap and icListen, with functionality to read, calibrate, and process hydrophone data into acoustic metrics.
    - Includes functionalities for:
      - Reading hydrophone data.
      - Performing spectral analyses.
         - spectral density (SPSD) 
         - spectral density levels (SPSDL) 
         - Fractional octave bands (e.g., third-octave, decidecade)
         - Sound Pressure Level (SPL)
      - Applying calibrations.
      - Calculating sound pressure levels.
      - Visualizing results.
      - Audio export
         -  To support users, an example notebook demonstrates the application of this module with workflows.
 * Strain Processing Example
    - The Strain Processing example introduces a workflow for analyzing strain gauge data, particularly from tidal turbine blade testing. While the functions are not included as a formal MHKiT module due to the variability of test setups, this example notebook provides a detailed and practical framework for processing such data.
    - Illustrates the calibration and processing of strain gauge data, showcasing a real-world application in tidal turbine testing.
    - Designed to accommodate the variability in strain gauge testing setups, enabling users to adapt the workflow to their specific needs.
    - Includes figures and explanations to contextualize the analysis and support data interpretation.
    - Reference:
       - Gunawan, B., Haulenbeek, K., Abdellatef, M., Streit, R., Lynn, E., Willis, M., Pendley, D., Gallegos-Patterson, D., Neary, V., Wosnik, M. (2024).

Enhancements: 

 * Wave Resource Module Performance
    - Optimizes the wave.resource module to improve performance and resolve issue #331 by transitioning from xarray.Dataset to xarray.DataArray for core functions. Handling edge cases robustly in pure numpy proved challenging, so the adoption of DataArray strikes a balance between performance and usability.
       - Transitioning to DataArray provides a significant speed-up—up to 1000x faster for very large datasets compared to the previous Dataset implementation.
       - While pure numpy would offer an additional 5-10x speed-up, DataArray ensures better usability and flexibility for both developers and users.
       - Restores the speed of MHKiT’s wave resource functions to their previous state, making the module more efficient for users working with large datasets.
       - Simplified input handling for `elevation_spectrum` and `surface_elevation` functions.
 * Surface Elevation Method Selection
    - Enhanced `surface_elevation` function to handle spectra without a zero frequency index.
    - Introduced an auto method for surface elevation calculations that selects the most suitable computation method based on the input spectrum:
       - Automatically switches to `sum_of_sines` method when Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) is not computable.
    - Added warnings to inform users of method changes.
    - Added an optional `frequency_dimension` parameter across all necessary wave.resource functions for better flexibility.
 * DOLfYN Cleaning Functions Update
    - Renamed and enhanced water depth calculation and surface interference removal functions for improved robustness.
    - Added an optional frequency_dimension parameter to relevant wave.resource functions, including significant_wave_height and others, to improve compatibility with xarray formats and enhance input flexibility.
    - Fixed issues identified in Issue #308
 * Reynolds Stress ADCP Estimation Notebook Improvements
    - Removed the `total_tke` function due to limitations of ADCP measurements in accurately estimating smaller turbulent scales and components of TKE.
    - Clarified the assumptions required for ADCP measurements:
       - Assumption of Homogeneity: Minimal vertical motion between beam measurements.
      - Spatial Resolution: Turbulent scales smaller than the beam distance cannot be resolved.
    - Expanded explanations of TKE shear production, emphasizing the limitations of ADCP-derived Reynolds stress and TKE estimations compared to point measurements from ADV and shear probes.
    - Corrected heading rotation logic to prevent rotation beyond 360 degrees.
    - Expanded the ADV notebook to cover all relevant functions, emphasizing the accuracy and reliability of ADV measurements for TKE components and Reynolds stress.
 * Type Handling Improvements
    - Fixed a bug in wave performance Mean Annual Energy Production (MAEP) matrix calculation (Issue #339).
    - Improved type handling between `Datasets` and `DataArrays`, enhancing function robustness.
 * NOAA Request Function Update
    - Fixed imprecise error handling in `mhkit.tidal.io.noaa.request_noaa_data` to ensure meaningful and actionable error messages.
    - Enhanced functionality to support additional NOAA data request parameters (e.g., `datum`) for variables such as water level, water temperature, and salinity.
    - Fixed Issue #223.

Bug fixes:

 * Numpy 2.0 Compatibility
 * Flow Duration Curve Plot Bug Fix
    - Fixed a bug in the flow duration curve plotting function related to matplotlib >= 3.8.
    - Corrected the `sortby` assignment to use the correct value.
 * Matplotlib Version Compatibility
    - Removed the matplotlib version check previously required for versions < 3.8.0.
    - Ensured compatibility with matplotlib >= 3.8.
 * Python 3.12 Support
    - Added support for Python 3.12.
 * Documentation Build Warnings Fix
    - Fixed minor spacing and formatting issues in the documentation that were causing warnings during the build process.

Testing and Continuous Integration Updates:

 * GitHub Actions Enhancements
    - **Notebook Testing**: Added a GitHub Action to test example notebooks as part of the Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline.
    - Implemented a timeout feature to fail notebooks that exceed a specified execution time.
    - **PyLint Enforcement**: Made the `utils` module PyLint compatible and enforced this compatibility via GitHub Actions.
    - **Testing Environment Consistency**: Updated the GitHub Actions testing environment to use the conda `environment.yml` file for consistency.
    - **Pylint Settings Update**: Updated Pylint settings and disabled specific warnings as necessary.
 * Wind Toolkit Tests Optimization
    - Optimized the Wind Toolkit tests, reducing test runtime from over 3.5 hours to approximately 2 hours by modifying the test data and aligning it with cached data used in the notebooks.
    - Replaced test data with smaller, representative datasets, improving efficiency without sacrificing robustness.
    - Ensured consistent use of cached data between hindcast tests and notebooks to minimize redundant API requests and reduce reliance on live NREL server calls.
 * MacOS Tests Fix
    - Adjusted test tolerances to fix failing tests on MacOS systems.
 * Updated Examples and Notebooks
    - Updated Jupyter notebooks for the new Acoustics module.
    - Fixed typos and updated examples in notebooks, including the Pacwave and CDIP examples.

 * Updated `folium` map calls in the Pacwave example to align with the latest `folium` API changes.
 * Use main as the MHKiT default branch
    - Many modern projects use `main` as the default branch, aligning with the GitHub recommendation and broader conventions.
    - There is some non-linear history in the previous rebase causing issues between `develop` & `master`
    - `main` was created from the current develop branch creating a 1-to-1 liner history between develop and the new main branch
